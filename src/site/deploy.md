# One of your very own

Hopefully, this little utility is already useful, but you can also get your own version to deploy and experiment with. It is a useful example for getting started with [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/03/20/netlifys-aws-lambda-functions-bring-the-backend-to-your-frontend-workflow/)

## Instructions

To get your own instance of this example site up and running on Netlify very quickly, just click the button below and follow the instructions.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/philhawksworth/twavatar)


## Wait, what happens when I click that button?

Good question. Here's what it will do...

1. We'll clone the git repository of this project into your Github account. We'll be asking for permission to add the repo for you.
2. We'll create a new site for you in Netlify, and configure it to use your shiny new repo. Right away you'll be able to deploy changes simply by pushing changes to your repo.
3. That's it really.
